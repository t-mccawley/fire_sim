# fire_sim
A simulation used for FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) planning.

Simulates an account balance post retirement by modeling the S&P 500 annual returns as a normal distribution fit to historical data.
The output `Risk` represents the number of iterations (simulation from retirement to death) for which the account balance ended negative (driven primarily by Sequence of Returns Risk).
